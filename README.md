# COMP-560-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an implementation of a 3D tic-tac-toe game using reinforcement learning.

To run this program, download the GitHub repository and copy the location of the repository and cd to it in a terminal.
Next, type "javac TrainAI.java" and hit enter. <br>
Finally, type "java TrainAI" and hit enter.

If successful, you should be prompted with a task to enter three numbers.

When entering a number, type the number and then press enter.

For example: <br>
100 <br>
200 <br>
500 <br>

For each number imputted, there should be 64 utility values, which represent each individual square in the game board.

Check out our HW2.pdf file for an explaination of our thought process/implementation.

Contributions:
We all worked together for the most part in person, but had a few individual contributions as well
Everett: Implemented the Board class, AI class, Point class, Tile class, and the TrainAI class
David: Implemented Board class, AI class
Yosef: Implemented Board class, AI class
Together: Discussed the logic behind all the classes and the utility algorithm. And we all debugged all the classes together.
